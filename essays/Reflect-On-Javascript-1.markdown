## Opinion on JavaScript

After completing the Basic JavaScript section on Free Code Camp there are some features which C, C++ and Java do not have that I like.

### Variables

I love that variables are not restricted to any datatypes. Although most variables make sense to always be a number or only store a string I find it very useful for functions, particularly for errors. This way if a function is supposed to return a number, yet an error occurs, the function can return a string describing the error without the use of exceptions, which I find cumbersome at times.

### Arrays

The size of an array can be changed natively throughout the program with <code>.pop()</code>, <code>.push()</code>, <code>.shift()</code> and <code>.unshift()</code>. They also give arrays the inbuilt functionality of a stack or a queue. Unfortunately the functions only work for the beginning and end of the array. However, JavaScript arrays already have more functionality than the languages I currently use.

For details on what these functions do check [this post.](https://www.bennadel.com/blog/1796-javascript-array-methods-unshift-shift-push-and-pop.htm)

### Function Parameters

The parameters for a function do not use <code>let</code> or <code>const</code>, only the name of the parameter is used. I suppose I never thought of using a constant parameter though. This feature leaves the function definition shorter and looks nicer than specifying <code>let</code> or <code>const</code> would be, in my opinion.

## Workout of the Day (WOD)

The WOD is a short programming exercise to be completed within a time constraint. The time constraint does not leave much time, if any, to look in a book or online for how functions work or what the syntax should be.

### The Good

* WODs promote learning the syntax and functions rather than checking how it works each time.
* Practices quick thinking to solve problems.
* Find out what skills still need work.

### The Bad

* A single typo can ruin your time.
* Sometimes there does not seem to be enough time to think of the solution.

### The Ugly (Truth)

Repeating the same programming exercise does not actually help much. Once you can get to the correct solution repeating the exercise is merely trying to write it faster. The time spent trying to improve your time on one exercise would be better spent working on a different exercise.

The only time repeating the exercise seemed to useful for me was to practice the formatting style used for class. It would also be useful for other consistent mistakes that would show me down should I run into any.

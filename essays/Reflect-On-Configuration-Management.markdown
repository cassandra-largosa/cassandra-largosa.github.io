Configuration management is tracking the changes made to the files that make up a system. If something were to stop working in the system after an update it is easy to revert to the previous working version, when good configuration management techniques are employed. Tracking the changes also means having a relatively easy way to find what caused the problem after the update.

Proper configuration management is important. More so when working with a team, which in the workplace is bound to happen. When working with a team it is difficult to know what everyone is has changed, there needs to be an efficient way to track the changes so that if something fails to work properly the cause of the problem can be found regardless of how many members of team are available at the time when the problem was found.

Although I have yet to fall victim to poor configuration management I am aware of what can happen. A friend of mine had been working on a group assignment, he just added some new code and went to test it. It went horribly wrong with the program generating an empty file, endlessly. After killing the process he went to inspect his code to see what he did wrong. After a day of finding nothing that would cause the problem in his own code he realized that another member had changed something in a completely separate part of the code, which happened to be the source of the problem. Had they used proper configuration management techniques it would have taken less time to inspect the  changes that had been made between the time the program was functioning and when he had tested it, thus saving his time and the assignment would have progressed faster.

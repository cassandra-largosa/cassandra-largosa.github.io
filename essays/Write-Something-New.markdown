A framework can make developing faster by providing code that has common uses so that developers may focus on the code specific to the project. However, frameworks also take time to learn thus, if the time it takes to learn is longer than the time it would take to simply implement the code than time is lost. How do you decide whether or not to use a framework?

Consider a website for a company. Over time the company may bring in a new web developer to update and maintain the site. Say the website did not use a framework, but has a CSS stylesheet. Now this new developer has to learn what is implement in the stylesheet and how. Less time is being spent on the job itself. But what if the site used a UI framework instead? Well, if this new developer has never used the framework than they still spend time learning however, if they do recognize the framework than they can spend their time doing the job instead. Using an existing framework can make new developers on a project more efficient.

Spending time learning a framework means being able to understand code that uses that framework.

Write the same code enough times you may want to make your own framework or library, but why reinvent the wheel, so to speak.

If you cannot think of a way to make your framework different than what already exist than it would be a waste of time to make it. Even you would have to spend time becoming use to it.

Build using a tool that exists, when you realize that a feature is missing or does not function the way you need it to, this is the time to bring in your skills without the framework.

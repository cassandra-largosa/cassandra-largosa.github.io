I took an interest in Computer Science when I thought about how fun it might be to create video games. However, I was uncertain about attending college for something I had no clue if I would actually enjoy. Then a teacher at my high school offered a course about game development and I used that as an opportunity to see if it was really something I wanted to do. Though there was not much coding for the class, I found it very satisfying. So I decided to attend college for a degree in Computer Science.

Then when I took programming courses in college I discovered there was more to the field that I enjoyed than game development. There was a certain satisfaction I felt to writing code and seeing it work. Now I enjoy coding in general.

Working with others has never been one of my strengths, being introverted. However, knowing that in the future I will need to work with others to be successful I hope to develop better communication skills. I would also like to gain some experience in working with other peoples code, be it a friends or open source to better improve my own programming skills.

The essay [How To Ask Questions The Smart Way](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) gives advice on how to ask questions to receive a useful response.

## Good Question
[Why is it faster to process a sorted array than an unsorted array?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11227809/why-is-it-faster-to-process-a-sorted-array-than-an-unsorted-array)

This question has a very concise header. The body makes it very clear what the details of the question is. The question also does not appear to be easily searchable, at least at the time it was posted.

The responses to this are very descriptive of why the answer is what it is and very well formatted. The response also came quickly. The positive votes indicate that the community thought this was a good question. 

## Poor Question

[Forcing a function to return if false](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21068763/forcing-a-function-to-return-if-false)

First, this person created a poor subject header that does not express what it is they are trying to do clearly. Although the body of the post makes the question much clearer it is apparent that the asker did not put much effort into finding the solution on their own. They have not checked to see what <code>return</code> is meant to do and is shown trying to use it for a different purpose. Then in the question the asker expresses that they wish to create a loop, which from what their end goal is, it is precisely what they want to do. Had the asker done a search using 'loop' as a keyword there would be no need to ask the question.

Though the responses do not indicate annoyance the large number of negative votes indicates that many people found this question to be a waste of time.

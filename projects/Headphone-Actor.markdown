Headphone Actor was a game I made as my final project for ICS 110. It was based on a game of the same name in the anime Mekakucity Actors. Due to the fact that I used the characters and name the app I never bothered putting the app on the app store. Also due to the fact that App Inventor is like Scratch, where the code is not written but rather feels like puzzle pieces put together, I cannot show all the code without taking many screenshots. However shown is a snippet of code from my function to initialize the Boss for the level. <img class="ui large right floated image" src="../images/HeadphoneActorCodeSnipet.png">

Working on this project gave me experience in game development on a scale larger than what I have done prior. For this project I had much more freedom of what I could do partially due to the fact that the project was of my own choosing and partially due to the greater capabilities that App Inventor had compared to what I had used for game making in my high school class.

The game required me to think very carefully about how to create the progression of level difficulty. I needed to make sure that the game did not get too hard, too fast, yet also make sure that there was still a challenge. It took me a bit of trail and error to find the right balance.

Another challenge was balancing the playable characters so that they were different yet, no one was better than the other. I ensured that each character could succeed in every level of the game. At the same time each character had a level that they excelled at and one that posed a great challenge to them; the character that was the best at the hardest level turned out to be the worst at the easiest. In this way a player had a way to make the levels easier or harder by their choice in character.

For the game I had also created my own graphics, working with pixel art for the first time. <img class= "ui small left floated image" src="../images/Explosion.png ">

The project exercised my creative abilities and my game design abilities.
